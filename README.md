## Installation ##

Type `npm install` to install the dependencies written in package.json configuration file.

The `npm install` command creates `node_modules` directory in the project directory and install the following packages:
1.`nodemon`: `Nodemon is a command-line interface that wraps your Node app, watch for file system and **automatically reloads the server when any changes have been made to the file without having to manually reload the server every time the file is saved.**`
2.`dotenv`: `This npm package is needed to load the environment variables (or tokens) from .env file into process.env environment variable.`
3. `express`: `Express is minimalist **web framework for NodeJS** that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is also known as Node Web Framework.`
4. `jsonwebtoken`: `The json web token (JWT) allows you to authenticate you users, without actually storing any information about them on the system itself. This module provides Express middleware for validating JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) through the **jsonwebtoken** module. `

Install `Rest Client` extension for VS Code, if you want to test the code.
